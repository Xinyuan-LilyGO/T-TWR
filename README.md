## News

#### There are the following differences between Rev2.1 and Rev2.0

1. Rev2.1 has a microphone switching matrix that can collect microphone signals for processing by ESP32S3, but Rev2.0 does not.
2. Rev2.1 has a speaker switching matrix, which can send audio signals to the power amplifier to play prompts, music, etc. through the switching matrix. Rev2.0 does not have it.
3. Rev2.1 has an IO switching matrix, and SA8X8 can be programmed through the switching matrix. Rev2.0 does not have this feature. This feature was proposed by the OpenRTX team. The function is not yet implemented. Please pay attention to OpenRTX for the latest progress.
4. Rev2.1 can determine whether the device address is UHF or VHF through OLED, but Rev2.0 cannot.
5. Rev2.1 can obtain whether the SA8X8 is currently in the receiving state by monitoring IO2, but Rev2.0 cannot..
6. In Rev2.1, the PTT button is changed to the left side, which is closer to the real walkie-talkie operating habits, while in Rev2.0, it is on the right side.
7. Rev2.1 changes the pixel light to the upper right to make it easier to monitor the status, Rev2.0 is on the side of the PCB
8. Rev2.1 reserves the RF front-end matching circuit, which makes it easier to fine-tune the signal.
9. The Rev2.1 RF module power supply is changed to direct battery power supply. Compared with the Rev2.0 DC power supply method, the power supply noise is minimized and can provide better RF performance.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ FAQ

1. ‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† **Precautions (special matters)**:
    1. The **glue stick (RF) antenna** must be connected. If the antenna is not connected, the RF module may be damaged, and the PMU will automatically turn off the power output
    2. A separate USB power supply may not meet the power supply requirements, please connect the battery to use , **The Rev2.1 version must use a battery to power the radio frequency unit and cannot use USB to work alone (because the RF current is very large and the noise can be minimized using battery power)**
    3. Please note that when adjusting to high power transmission, please ensure that the battery has sufficient discharge capacity, otherwise the PMU will automatically shut down due to insufficient current.
    4. TWR Rev2.0 has two versions, one comes with NiceRF AT firmware, and the other is a community version without any functions. For the community version, please jump to [OpenRTX](https://github.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX) to burn [OpenRTX SA8x8 firmware](https://github.com/OpenRTX/sa8x8-fw) for use. For novices, it is recommended to use NiceRF firmware.
    5. TWR Rev2.1 is version agnostic. The built-in NiceRF firmware can be flashed to OpenRTX firmware, but the NiceRF firmware cannot be restored after flashing.


2. Radio extremely hot when sending?
      1. If the power level is set to high, then the current consumption is huge and the efficiency is very low. It is not recommended to use high power because the difference between high and low power is very small, but the difference in current consumption is very large. You can check the comparison here

      | Voltage | Freq | High transmit power                    | Low transmit power                   |

        1. Not recommended, changing the peripheral voltage may cause abnormal operation, please do not change the default voltage setting of the peripheral, please refer to the voltage setting in the sample program.
      </details>

4. ‚ö† **Why can't I test the charging current to reach the set current?**
      <details>
      <summary>
      Click to view detailed steps
      </summary>
       1. If you use a USBC cable with low quality or too large or too long wire resistance, there will be a large internal resistance, and there is no rated 5V input on the board, so the PMU will think that the power supply voltage is insufficient, so the rated charging current cannot be reached. ,The solution is to replace the high-quality USBC wire, reduce the length of the wire to meet the requirements of the PMU input voltage<br>
       2. You can measure the voltage at both ends of the figure below to see if it can meet the 5V input voltage required by the PMU<br>
         <img width="320"  src=images/input-voltage.jpg>

      1. Please note that if the charging current is set to 1A, please install a suitable heat sink above the PMU to reduce the risk of heat and damage caused by overheating.
      </details>

5.  ‚ö†  When you think there is a problem with the board, you can try to burn our [factory firmware](./firmware/README.MD) for testing, you can first rule out whether it is a hardware problem

6. ‚ö† **I don‚Äôt have a **21700 battery**, can I replace the battery holder with a **18650** battery holder?**

      1. Connect the battery separately, you need to press the **PWR button** for one second, the board will start the action, press and hold the **PWR** button for 6 seconds to shut down, the shutdown time can be set by software , In the latest version (Rev2.1), inserting the battery will automatically power on.
      </details>

8. TWR currently has two modes before leaving the factory, one is flashed with regular firmware and uses the esp built-in boot, and the other uses TinyUF2 as the boot program. For novices, please [see here](./firmware/README.MD)

9.  How to enter TinyUF2 boot mode?
