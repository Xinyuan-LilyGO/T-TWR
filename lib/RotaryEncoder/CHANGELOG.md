## [1.5.0] - 2021-02-06

* CHANGELOG created.

* Many thanks to the improvements included from **@deltaphi** (#12), **@rprediger** (#22) and **@giupo** (#24) 

* The function **getMillisBetweenRotations()** was added. See example AcceleratedRotator.

* The function **getRPM()** was added.


### Examples

* The examples also compile with ESP8266 and Every boards. (the library worked already).

* new **LatchMode** in initialization supporting rotary encoders with 2 state changes from one latch to the next (LatchMode).

* The **InterruptRotator** example now uses attachInterrupt() instead of ATMega registers and ISR. (The old code is still in comments).
