This is LIBFLAC 1.3.2 ported to the ESP8266 by Earle F. Philhower, III
<earlephilhower@yahoo.com>.  It's pretty much unchanged from base sourcew,
with some CRC and string constants moved into PROGMEM.  Headers have been
purged of references to STDIO/FILE*.  Files not needed for playback have
been removed.
